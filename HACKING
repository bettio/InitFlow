initFlow has been written in C using C99 standard with GNU extensions.
C99 standard is supported by all relevant C compilers that targets Linux systems
(GCC, CLANG, etc...).

Code has been written using a object oriented like paradigm as used in other
software projects like GLib.
The following rules must be respected:
- Class methods must be defined like: classname_method(ClassName *c, ...)
- Classes must be instantiated by using ClassName *classname_new(...) or by using
   any other factory method.
- Classes that allow inheritance must have a classname_constructor(ClassName *c)
   method that must be used for base class initialization.
- Objects must be deleted using classname_destroy(ClassName *c) method.
- Structs forward declaration should be used as often as possible and it must be
   always used for public headers.
- d-pointers are mandatory for public ABI classes that are meant to be subclassed
  by third party applications in order to avoid changes to the in memory object
  layout.
