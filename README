initFlow is an init daemon for Linux systems written in C and licensed as GPLv2.

initFlow design is similar to systemd design and it borrows some concepts from it.
First of all every startup unit (service, socket, mount, etc...) is a unit and
it inherits its properties.
When system boots, shutdown or restarts an init target is reached. Every target
requires some units that are installed as symlinks inside the .target.wants
directory.

initFlow supports the following types of units:
- service: an executable service that can be launched by initFlow
- mount: a filesystem on a certain device that can be mounted on a target directory
- interface: a net interface that should be brought up with a certain configuration
- route: a network route that should be configured

kernel requirements:
CONFIG_SIGNALFD must be enabled and kernel version must be at least 2.6.27.
